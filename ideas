Patch - a digraph of Component
    formed as an array of Component objects/references which refer
     to each other by index
    also contains a list of all PatchInstances
    is a template for PatchInstances (that's how we do subroutines)

Component -
    has parameters and other data (text data, envelope curve)
    has references to other components to form digraph -- probably
     by index number (see Patch)
    NOT real time internal data
    reference to ComponentType
    Index of component within patch (and patch instance!)
    

PatchInstance -
    pointer to Patch
    array of componentInstances, indexed using the same indices
     as the corresponding components in the patch.
    
ComponentInstance -
    input and output values
    Component reference
    internal data


Subroutines:
    a macro component contains a patch instance. Special components
    within the instance refer to the macro component in the parent
    patch --- the links are set up on creation.
