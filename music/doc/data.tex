\comp{diamond}
{Receives data from \emph{Diamond Apparatus} topics}
{}{out:float}
Receives data from a single floating point topic on Diamond Apparatus,
and outputs it.
\startparams
topic & string & name of the topic\\
mul & float & topic is multiplied by this\\
add & float & added to the multiplied result
\end{tabularx}

\comp{OSC-out}
{Sends data over Open Sound Control protocol}
{in$\times$6:float}{flow:flow}
Sends data over OSC (Open Sound Control) as a float array.
Typically this is to a SuperCollider program, so the port
is set to 57120. Only connected ports are sent, so if three
ports are connected the message will be three floats. A message
is only sent if one of the inputs has changed value since last
time.
\startparams
topic & string & name of the topic (e.g. \texttt{/foo})\\
\end{tabularx}
