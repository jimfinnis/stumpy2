* lengthen duration (pow2 mult)
make the gap in chordplay relate to the chord length (no, make it seconds).
make the select input in chordplay an integer (so can be fed from denseq)
add a transpose to chordplay (for octaves down, etc)
chord note select player :
    - fed by denseq typically
    - two trigger inputs.
        - start: in non-freerun mode, starts the sequence
        - note: triggers each note
    - in free-run mode the start input isn't used, it just loops.
    - chord input
    
crossfader, and global vel multiplier for it. Works with a float
input, so 0 gives all 0, 0.5 gives 0.5 of 0 and 0.5 of 1. Flow
inputs.

ramps/envelopes (have to be quite long in duration)
perlin noise

switcher for other types?
