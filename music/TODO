* lengthen duration (pow2 mult)
* make the gap in chordplay relate to the chord length (no, make it seconds).
* make the select input in chordplay an integer (so can be fed from denseq)
* other osc waveforms 

* add a transpose to chordplay (for octaves down, etc)
* chord note select player :
    - note select input, fed by denseq typically
    - two trigger inputs.
        - gate: don't play anything if low AND connected
        - note: triggers each note
    - in free-run mode the start input isn't used, it just loops.
    - chord input
  
* Clocks go out of sync!
* ramps/envelopes (have to be quite long in duration)

Should be impossible to close lib. with a patch open

Mixer.
  
crossfader, and global vel multiplier for it. Works with a float
input, so 0 gives all 0, 0.5 gives 0.5 of 0 and 0.5 of 1. Flow
inputs.

Trigger. If no input, triggers at patch sync, otherwise triggers when
input goes above or below threshold (rising/leading edge is boolean).
Has an N second delay. Idiom: multiple triggers firing from a long ramp.

threshgate:
    float i/o pairs + gate + threshmodulator.
    If input not connected, is assumed to be 1. (to act as thresh).
    If gate>thresh, outputs=inputs, else outputs=0
    

perlin noise

switcher for other types?
